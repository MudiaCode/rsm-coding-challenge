# MSR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## A fully functional company management system which allows the user to setup, add/remove, view employees in each office and offices within the company!

Coding challenge provided by RSM UK (Thank you for the opportunity)

This is a project made to help a CEO to setup offices and employees without the use of speadsheets. Completely written in Java using IntelliJ and some experimentation with my neovim developer environment.
The MSR Management System is a simple system containing essential features:

* Create offices
* Add employees to offices
* Remove employees from offices
* Transfer employees from one office to another
* Display a list of employees within a specific office
* Display a list of all available offices
